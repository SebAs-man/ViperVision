> A modern take on the classic Snake game, engineered with a focus on clean, decoupled architecture, classic design patterns, and multiple AI-driven gameplay modes.

ViperVision is a comprehensive implementation of the Snake game built from the ground up using Java and the Processing library for rendering. More than just a game, it serves as a practical case study for applying robust software design principles to build a flexible, maintainable, and extensible application.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Smooth, interpolated movement, food consumption, and score tracking.
* **Multiple Game Modes:**
    * **Human Player:** Take control with the arrow keys in a responsive input-buffered system.
    * **Pathfinding AI (WIP):** Watch the snake autonomously navigate using algorithms like A* to find the optimal and safest path to the food.
    * **Genetic Algorithm AI (Planned):** Observe an AI that evolves and learns to play through generations of simulated evolution.
* **Polished UI/UX:** Interactive menus with custom fonts, graphics, and a fluid game loop.
* **Clean, Decoupled Architecture:** Built to be easily understood, modified, and extended.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

ViperVision is engineered with a strong focus on a clean, unidirectional dependency flow, preventing circular dependencies and promoting high cohesion and low coupling.

* **Core Architectural Principle:** The architecture is designed around a central **`core` package**, which acts as the game engine's API. It contains the main game loop, configuration, assets, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîthe **interfaces** that define the application's contracts (`State`, `ControlStrategy`, `SnakeAPI`, etc.).
* **Unidirectional Dependencies:** All other packages (`states`, `strategies`, `entities`) are implementation details that **depend on `core`**, but `core` does not depend on them. This creates a clean, maintainable, and testable structure.
* **Dependency Injection:** To break cycles, dependencies are "wired up" at the highest level possible. The `Main` class injects initial states, and the `PlayingState` is responsible for creating and resetting game entities, acting as the setup manager for a new game session.
* **State Pattern:** Manages the game's high-level states (Menu, Playing, Paused, GameOver) using a **State Stack**. This allows for clean transitions, pausing/resuming, and complex menu flows.
* **Strategy Pattern:** Decouples the game logic from the snake's control mechanism. This allows switching seamlessly between different "strategies" (Human, Pathfinding AI, etc.) without changing any core game code.
