> A modern take on the classic Snake game, engineered with a focus on clean architecture, design patterns, and multiple AI-driven gameplay modes.

ViperVision is a comprehensive implementation of the Snake game built from the ground up using Java and the Processing library for rendering. More than just a game, it serves as a practical case study for applying robust software design principles like the State and Strategy patterns, resulting in a flexible, maintainable, and extensible codebase.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Smooth, grid-based movement, food consumption, and score tracking.
* **Multiple Game Modes:**
    * **Human Player:** Take control with the arrow keys in a responsive input-buffered system.
    * **Pathfinding AI:** Watch the snake autonomously navigate using algorithms like A* or Dijkstra to find the optimal path to the food.
    * **Genetic Algorithm AI (WIP):** Observe an AI that evolves and learns to play through generations of simulated evolution.
* **Polished UI:** Interactive menus, custom fonts, and improved game aesthetics.
* **Robust Architecture:** Built to be easily understood, modified, and extended.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

This project is engineered with a strong focus on applying proven software design principles:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Core logic is decoupled from rendering, input, and UI.
* **State Pattern:** Manages the game's states (Menu, Playing, Paused, GameOver) by encapsulating state-specific behaviors into their own classes. This makes adding or changing states clean and simple.
* **Strategy Pattern:** Dynamically switches the snake's control mechanism between different "strategies" (Human, Pathfinding AI, etc.), allowing for modular and interchangeable gameplay modes.
* **Singleton Pattern:** Used for managing stateless objects like game states, strategies, and asset loaders to ensure efficiency and a single point of access.
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Game objects are built with a focus on what they *do* (interfaces like `Drawable`, `Updatable`) rather than what they *are*, promoting flexibility.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **JDK 24** (or the version specified in `pom.xml`). Make sure `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly.
* **Apache Maven** installed and configured in your system's PATH.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SebAs-man/ViperVision.git
    cd ViperVision
    ```
2.  **Build the project using Maven:** This will compile the code and package it into an executable JAR in the `target/` directory.
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```
