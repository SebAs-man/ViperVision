> A modern take on the classic Snake game, engineered with a focus on clean, decoupled architecture, classic design patterns, and multiple AI-driven gameplay modes.

ViperVision is a comprehensive implementation of the Snake game built from the ground up using Java and the Processing library for rendering. More than just a game, it serves as a practical case study for applying robust software design principles to build a flexible, maintainable, and extensible application.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Smooth, interpolated movement, food consumption, and score tracking.
* **Multiple Game Modes:**
    * **Human Player:** Take control with the arrow keys in a responsive input-buffered system.
    * **Pathfinding AI (WIP):** Watch the snake autonomously navigate using algorithms like A* to find the optimal and safest path to the food.
    * **Genetic Algorithm AI (Planned):** Observe an AI that evolves and learns to play through generations of simulated evolution.
* **Polished UI/UX:** Interactive menus with custom fonts, graphics, and a fluid game loop.
* **Clean, Decoupled Architecture:** Built to be easily understood, modified, and extended.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

ViperVision is engineered with a modern, decoupled architecture focusing on the Single Responsibility Principle and Composition over Inheritance. This ensures the codebase is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
* **Core Principles**
  * **Unidirectional Dependencies**: The architecture centers around a core package that defines the application's contracts (interfaces). All other packages (entities, states, strategies, ui) depend on core, but core does not depend on them. This prevents circular dependencies and creates a clean, plug-and-play structure.
  * **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are provided to objects rather than created by them. For instance, the PlayingState is injected with a ControlStrategy, allowing it to function without knowing the concrete type of the strategy.
* **Design Patterns in Use**  
The project heavily relies on established design patterns to solve common problems elegantly:  
  * **State Pattern**: Manages the game's high-level flow (MenuState, PlayingState, PausedState, etc.). Each state encapsulates its own logic, and a Game class context seamlessly transitions between them using a state stack.
  * **Strategy Pattern**: Decouples the snake's control logic from the main game loop. This allows switching between different control mechanisms (HumanControlStrategy, FollowFoodStrategy) without altering any core game code.
  * **Command Pattern**: Decouples UI components (like Button) from the actions they perform. Buttons are given a Command object to execute on click, making them highly reusable and configurable.
  * **Singleton Pattern**: Used for global, unique objects like GameRenderer or stateless objects like HumanControlStrategy to ensure a single instance exists throughout the application, saving resources.
  * **Composite & Layout Manager**: The UI is built using a composite structure. UiComponent is the base interface for elements like buttons and labels. Layout classes (e.g., VerticalLayout) act as composite objects that manage and arrange collections of components. This creates a powerful, reusable, and declarative UI system.
  * **Provider Pattern (a form of DI)**: The UiProvider interface allows objects like a ControlStrategy to provide a list of UI components to the current State without the state needing to know the strategy's concrete type. This is key to building dynamic UIs.
